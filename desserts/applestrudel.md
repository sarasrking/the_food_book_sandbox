# Apple Strudel 

## Ingredients
750g/1lb Bramley apples, peeled, cored, quartered and sliced  
1½ tsp ground cinnamon  
½ unwaxed lemon, zest only  
2 tsp lemon juice  
100g golden caster sugar  
75g raisins  
95g butter  
40g white breadcrumbs  
6 large sheets filo pastry  
1 tbsp icing sugar  

## Method
1. Preheat the oven to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 5. Line a baking tray with baking parchment.
2. Mix the apples with the cinnamon, lemon zest and juice, sugar and raisins. In a small frying pan, melt 20g/¾oz butter and fry the breadcrumbs until goldenbrown, then add to the apple mixture.
3. Melt the remaining butter in a pan. On a clean, dry teatowel lay a sheet of the filo and brush with some of the melted butter. Lay another sheet on top and repeat until you have used all of the filo.
4. Pile the filling along the length of the pastry along one side about 23cm/
1in from the edge and using the teatowel to help you, roll the pastry up to enclose the filling. Tuck the ends in and roll seamside down onto the lined baking sheet. Brush with the remaining melted butter.
5. Bake for 40-45 minutes, until goldenbrown.
Leave to cool to room temperature and dust
